# there are two implementations of the subagent daemon:
# 1) the default bdb version
# 2) a zero mq based version
# if you want to use this agent you need at least 
# libnet-snmp-perl installed.
# the zeromq version also needs libzeromq-perl.
# You also have to enable zeromq
# in amavis: $enable_zmq = 1; 
#  
# See RELEASE_NOTES for details.
